      He seems to think using obscure and confusing words somehow makes him relatable.
      Nobody actually talks like that! He just made himself into more of a fool.
      Besides, he wasn't actually concerned with workers' well-being.
      Even if it wasn't your fault, if you missed your quota, you got a demerit.
      He would just talk over anybody who protested.

      You gotta pay a lot of tithes to get in, and even after that, it is extremely hard to pass.
      !angry_shrug
      One of the criteria to pass is "demonstrate a strong belief in Hesh", which is very vague.
      There's this one priest who clearly is not devoted, yet she managed to convince the teacher to let her pass.
      How is that fair?

      And this is why we need mandatory citizenship.
      Just the other day, someone came to the Admiralty headquarters asking for some paperwork.
      What was his name again? Al- El-? I can't exactly remember.
      It's obviously a fake name. Never in Havaria have I heard of this name.

    player:
      Uhh... What's the point?
    agent:
      The point is! There is no way for either of us to prove whether he is Havarian, or that is his real name.
      And we are powerless against that! We then have no choice but to authorize the paperwork to this person with an obvious fake name.
      If we have mandatory citizenship, then we can easily check, and prevent this from happening in the first place.

      In fact, more than that. He wants to be good at everything, no matter what.

        Thanks. Glad to find another person who enjoys a good poetry.

      I've been cooking up something that will surely get the workers on our side!
    player:
      !clap
      Well, what are you waiting for? Lay it on me!
    agent:

      Here it is. Take a good look.
    player:

    * {agent} hands you a propaganda poster.
    * Depicted on it is a laborer's hand holding up a hammer.
    * At the bottom of the poster is the caption "Till death, we fight".
    player:
      !dubious
      "Till death, we fight"?
    agent:
      !agree
      Yeah. Time has proven over and over again that nothing ever changes, if people sacrifice their ideals to save their own skin.
      If you really want any changes, you must be willing to sacrifice your life for the cause.
    {anti_labor_law?
      player:
        !crossed
        If your cause requires the sacrifice of innocent lives, then perhaps it isn't a cause worth fighting for.
      agent:
        !thought
        Hmm... I suppose that it does come out that way. I need to rethink the slogan a bit.
    }
    {pro_labor_law?
      player:
        While I don't disagree, I feel like this is a bit exclusionary.
        The revolution can't happen with just a few radicals willing to sacrifice their lives.
        !thumb
        If we want the revolution to succeed, we need to get lots of people on board, not just the ones willing to fight to the death.
      agent:
        !agree
        I suppose you do have a point.
    }
    {not pro_labor_law and not anti_labor_law?
      player:

        I can't speak for everyone, but personally, I don't really want to die.
        And I'm pretty sure most people don't, either.
      agent:
        !thought
        Hmm... I suppose if I want my message to reach the masses, it needs to be more palatable.
    }
    agent:
      !happy
      Thanks for the feedback, {player}.

      Say, {player}, have I showed you my fascinating specimen named Jeremy?
    player:

      "Fascinating specimen"? Is that how you refer to your pet?

    {player_drunk?
      player:
        !drunk
        I have to agree. Hesh-knows-whats are fascinating creatures.
        They are between life and death, between plants and fungi, between bliss and agony, between-
      agent:
        !placate
        Okay, now you lost me.
      player:

      * Uh oh. It seems your stomach begins to turn.
      * You are not sure if it's from all the alcohol you drank, or the Hesh-knows-whats, or both.
      agent:
        !bashful
        You know what? I'm just going to put them away.
    }
    {not player_drunk?
      * They emit a smell that is hard to describe.
      player:
        !disgust
        Wh- What is that?
      agent:
        Well, I am developing an enzyme capable of synthesizing fuel from common materials.
        This is the 984th Jeremy.
      player:
        !bashful
        Well, that's quite a lot of Jeremys.
      agent:
        !neutral_notepad
        Seems like there are a couple of tweaks that need to be made.
        Anyway, I'm sure the next batch is going to be great.
      player:
        Yeah.
        $scaredStammering
        Totally.

      What can I say? When you've been on the derricks as long as I have, you learn a few tricks to keep yourself upright.
    agent:
      !placate
      Whoa! You worked in the derricks?
      No wonder I feel like out of all the candidates, you are the most down-to-earth one.

      Something's troubling you, my friend. What is it?

      I've been trying to iron out this bug for a while. Think you have an idea for it?
    player:
      !dubious
      How hard is it to squish a bug? Can't you just hit it really hard?
      Or, if it's like a flead queen, can't you just shoot it really hard?
    agent:
      Seems like there's some sort of misunderstanding.
      I am talking about a computer bug. You can't really hit it hard without breaking expensive machineries.
    player:
      !dubious
      A... computer bug?
    agent:

      Yeah. Says something about an error in the manifest organizer.

      You... don't just have a clerk for that?

      Why would we? We have computers.

      It's so rare for people in Havaria to have a loving family!
    {player_sober_today?
      * For the record, you are incredibly mean to Theroux, with your constant bullying and dangerous pranks.
      * Doesn't mean you don't care about him, but still, maybe you should actually start to be nice to him.
      * Unless your shenanigans have already gotten him killed. Please don't tell me that.
