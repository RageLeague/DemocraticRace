      [p] Another day of toil.
      The rich just gets richer, and the poor stays poor.
    player:
      That's rough, buddy.
      You know, I plan to change that once I'm in office.
    agent:
      !happy
      Thanks.
      Glad someone considers the common folks.

    agent:
      [p] Have I told you before that I worked for this Spark Baron.
      Always rambling about wanting to be relatable to the common folks.
      His idea of "being relatable" seems way different from how everyone else thinks.
    player:
      Really? How so?
    agent:
      He seems to think using obscure and confusing words somehow makes him relatable.
      First off, nobody talks like that.
      Second, he isn't actually concerned with the common folks' well-being.
      He wouldn't give a second thought to giving demerits to workers who miss their quota for something that is not their fault.
    player:
      !shrug
      What can you expect from a Spark Baron, though.
    agent:
      True.
      !happy
      Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambling. It has really lighten up my day.

      [p] Starting a business from the ground up is hard.
      Born to the wrong person, and you have to work ten times as hard. Often you don't even get any results.
    player:
      !shrug
      Same here to be honest. It's really hard competing against renowned members of prominent factions as a nameless grifter.
    agent:
      !agree
      Guess we are really in the same boat, huh?
    player:
      Yeah.
      Hope one day you can find your fortunes.
    agent:
      Same thing can be said to you, my friend.

    agent:
      [p] Have you heard of the tale of Gunter Trunoomiel?
    player:
      !thought
      Can't say I have, no.
    agent:
      He's like a small legend among us poor merchants.
      As a jarackle who owns nothing, he built up his business empire from the ground up.
    player:
      Sounds pretty impressive.
      I mean, I never dealt with the business side of things, but it seems virtually impossible for someone to make that much without a substantial starting funds.
    agent:
      !agree
      Yeah, which is precisely why he is impressive.
      I want to be as successful as him one day.
    player:
      !shrug
      Yeah... Good luck with that.

    player:
      [p] How hard it is to pass the priest school?
    agent:
      You would imagine it's pretty hard.
      You gotta pay a lot of tithes to get in, and even after that, it is extremely hard to pass.
      !angry_shrug
      One of the criteria to pass is "demonstrate a strong belief in Hesh", which is very vague.
      There's this one priest who clearly is not devoted, yet she managed to convince the teacher to let her pass.
      How is that fair?
    player:
      !shrug
      Well, different people have different way of showing devotion, I guess?
    agent:
      !sigh
      You are right.
      Hesh's will is unpredictable, and I shouldn't let my prejudice to cloud my judgement.
      I'm just a bit salty that I need to attempt the test multiple times to pass, that is all.

    agent:
      And this is why we need mandatory citizenship.
      Just the other day, someone came to the Admiralty headquarters asking for some paperwork.
      What was his name again? Al- El-? I can't exactly remember.
      It's obviously a fake name. Never in Havaria have I heard of this name.
    player:
      Uhh... What's the point?
    agent:
      The point is! There is no way for either of us to prove whether he is Havarian, or that is his real name.
      And we are powerless against that! We then have no choice but to authorize the paperwork to this person with an obvious fake name.
      If we have mandatory citizenship, then we can easily check, and prevent this from happening in the first place.
    player:
    {anti_independence?
      I, of course, fully support this notion.
      This is a serious issue if we allow people using pseudonyms in official documents.
    agent:
      Thank you. I knew I supported the right person.
    }
    {not anti_independence?
      This does sound like a serious issue. I will give it some thought.
      See if I can find a good way to deal with it.
    agent:
      !agree
      Of course. I knew I could count on you!

    agent:
      Ever feel like you sometimes live under your parents' shadow?
    player:
    {player_rook?
      You are talking to a retired Admiralty officer.
      I don't live under anyone's shadow.
    agent:
      This is merely a rhetorical question. I am still going to tell whatever it is that I am going to tell.
    player:
      Oh, Hesh.
    }
    {player_sal or player_smith?
      If I will be honest? Constantly.
      People place a lot of expectation on me when they learned who my parents are, and that feels like a lot of pressure sometimes.
    agent:
      Then, you are not alone.
    }
    {not (player_rook or player_sal or player_smith)?
      Not really.
      People usually care about who I am rather than who my parents are.
    agent:
      That's good. At least you don't have to deal with this problem.
    }
    agent:
      A friend of my friend is a highly successful merchant.
      He built a business empire from the ground up, which is pretty impressive.
      !sigh
      But his son... He always feels like everyone only cares about his father's achievement, not his.
    player:
      Well? What happens next?
    agent:
      He wants to be as successful as his father.
      In fact, more than that. He wants to be good at everything, no matter what.
      And it seems like he truly believes that, even though it is physically impossible to do so.
      That makes him insufferable, and people generally don't want to work with him.
    player:
      That seems extreme.
    agent:
      The point is, a lot of people might have some huge expectations from you.
      But don't go and try something unrealistic because of that, alright?
      Lest you walk the same path as him.

    agent:
      The Cult of Hesh is filled with a bunch of lunatics, worshipping a giant jellyfish that is probably going to kill us all.
    player:
      Wow, what a conversation starter!
    {not pro_religious_policy?
      But surely you can't just make gross generalizations like this! I'm sure there must be some level-headed people in the Cult.
    }
    {pro_religious_policy?
      But I'm pretty sure there are level headed people in the Cult, and you should probably not underestimate them.
    }
    agent:
      You know, it's funny that you said that.
      I know of a priest who is very collected and logical.
      She is probably more logical than some of my colleagues.
      Which makes me wonder: Why would such a logical person join the Cult, where logic is punished and only mindless fanaticism is accepted?
    player:
    {pro_religious_policy?
      Maybe she is right, and maybe the illogical one here is you.
      Have you considered that possibility?
    agent:
      It pains me to admit it, but maybe there really is something to this.
      I need to think about this a bit more.
      Thanks for the talk, by the way.
    }
    {not pro_religious_policy?
      Maybe there is an ulterior motive?
      There are plenty of reason to join the Cult other than worship.
      Money? Power? Or something else they seek inside the Cult?
    agent:
      You are probably right.
      Hey, do you think I should join the Cult?
    player:
      Nah. Based on your history with the Barons, they will probably kill you outright.
    agent:
      Yeah, you're right.
    }
