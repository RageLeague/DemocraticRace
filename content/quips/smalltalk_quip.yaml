      [p] Another day of toil.
      The rich just gets richer, and the poor stays poor.
    player:
      That's rough, buddy.
      You know, I plan to change that once I'm in office.
    agent:
      !happy
      Thanks.
      Glad someone considers the common folks.

    agent:
      [p] Have I told you before that I worked for this Spark Baron.
      Always rambling about wanting to be relatable to the common folks.
      His idea of "being relatable" seems way different from how everyone else thinks.
    player:
      Really? How so?
    agent:
      He seems to think using obscure and confusing words somehow makes him relatable.
      First off, nobody talks like that.
      Second, he isn't actually concerned with the common folks' well-being.
      He wouldn't give a second thought to giving demerits to workers who miss their quota for something that is not their fault.
    player:
      !shrug
      What can you expect from a Spark Baron, though.
    agent:
      True.
      !happy
      Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambling. It has really lighten up my day.

      [p] Starting a business from the ground up is hard.
      Born to the wrong person, and you have to work ten times as hard. Often you don't even get any results.
    player:
      !shrug
      Same here to be honest. It's really hard competing against renowned members of prominent factions as a nameless grifter.
    agent:
      !agree
      Guess we are really in the same boat, huh?
    player:
      Yeah.
      Hope one day you can find your fortunes.
    agent:
      Same thing can be said to you, my friend.

    agent:
      [p] Have you heard of the tale of Gunter Trunoomiel?
    player:
      !thought
      Can't say I have, no.
    agent:
      He's like a small legend among us poor merchants.
      As a jarackle who owns nothing, he built up his business empire from the ground up.
    player:
      Sounds pretty impressive.
      I mean, I never dealt with the business side of things, but it seems virtually impossible for someone to make that much without a substantial starting funds.
    agent:
      !agree
      Yeah, which is precisely why he is impressive.
      I want to be as successful as him one day.
    player:
      !shrug
      Yeah... Good luck with that.

    player:
      [p] How hard it is to pass the priest school?
    agent:
      You would imagine it's pretty hard.
      You gotta pay a lot of tithes to get in, and even after that, it is extremely hard to pass.
      !angry_shrug
      One of the criteria to pass is "demonstrate a strong belief in Hesh", which is very vague.
      There's this one priest who clearly is not devoted, yet she managed to convince the teacher to let her pass.
      How is that fair?
    player:
      !shrug
      Well, different people have different way of showing devotion, I guess?
    agent:
      !sigh
      You are right.
      Hesh's will is unpredictable, and I shouldn't let my prejudice to cloud my judgement.
      I'm just a bit salty that I need to attempt the test multiple times to pass, that is all.

    agent:
      And this is why we need mandatory citizenship.
      Just the other day, someone came to the Admiralty headquarters asking for some paperwork.
      What was his name again? Al- El-? I can't exactly remember.
      It's obviously a fake name. Never in Havaria have I heard of this name.
    player:
      Uhh... What's the point?
    agent:
      The point is! There is no way for either of us to prove whether he is Havarian, or that is his real name.
      And we are powerless against that! We then have no choice but to authorize the paperwork to this person with an obvious fake name.
      If we have mandatory citizenship, then we can easily check, and prevent this from happening in the first place.
    player:
    {anti_independence?
      I, of course, fully support this notion.
      This is a serious issue if we allow people using pseudonyms in official documents.
    agent:
      Thank you. I knew I supported the right person.
    }
    {not anti_independence?
      This does sound like a serious issue. I will give it some thought.
      See if I can find a good way to deal with it.
    agent:
      !agree
      Of course. I knew I could count on you!
    }
