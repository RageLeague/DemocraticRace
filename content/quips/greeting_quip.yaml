    player:
      Didn't expect to see you here, {agent}.
      Why are you here?
    agent:
      You know, because of the election, moving here just seems like good business.
      Why are you here, then?
    player:
      Running for president, of course.
      Why aren't you running? The Jakes could use a great leader like you.
    agent:
      Ah, of course.
      My days of glory are over. Now I'm just trying to get by and make some shills.
      Still, feel free to stay and have a drink.

      {player}?
    player:
      Got it in one. How-
    * Then, you froze.
    * Even though you haven't seen each other for ten years, you can still recognize {agent.himher} clearly.
    player:
      Prindo, is that you?
      !happy
      How long has it been? Ten years?
    agent:
      !agree
      Too long to keep track of.
      What brought you here? I presume that you have taken an interest in the election?
    player:
      Yeah. I plan to run as a candidate.
    agent:
      It looks like only one of us can succeed, then.
      We might be competitors, but I will do whatever I can to help you.
    player:
      Thanks.
    agent:
      In the mean time, is there anything you need?

    agent:
      Didn't expect to see you here, old chum!
    player:
      !crossed
      I will have you know that I am running for president, so me being here is completely expected.
    agent:
      You will need more than stealth and espionage if you want to win the election.
      !chuckle
      But I guess, in that aspect, we are in the same boat.
      Anyway, if you need anything, I will see what I can do to help.

    agent:
      What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be drinking in some rundown bar or something?
    player:
      !angry_accuse
      Hey! I will have you know that I am running for president!
    agent:
      !agree
      If you are speaking the truth, then perhaps it's finally time for you to do something useful.
      Of course, I am not going to make it easier for you.
      I actually want to win.
    player:
      You say that, but just wait until I beat you and win.

    agent:
      !crossed
      Didn't I say I can do this by myself?
      Why did you show up now, all of a sudden?
    player:
      I'm not here to help you win, per se.
      I am running for president as well, so that the Barons don't put all their eggs in one basket.
      This way, even if one of us loses the election, the other person can still win.
    agent:
      !sigh
      I suppose that is a fair arrangement.
