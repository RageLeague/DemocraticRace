      There's a great place that I often visit.
      I should let you know.
      Just in case, you know, you want to go there during your free time.
      It's called {loc_to_unlock#location}.
    player:
      Great, thanks.

      Ever enjoy an ice cold cup of plonk with a nice view of the land?
    player:
      Well... maybe?
    agent:
      Well, I know this little bar where you can find the best view of Havaria.
      Swing by the Grog n' Dog when you get chance.
      They sell amazing drinks, and people from all factions visit there, incase you need some more connections.
      You should definitely go check it out!
#I'm assuming just attaching this little thing at the end will check for the character. pardon me while I make the common smith conversation.

      Best view I've ever had was out of a large lumin pipe onto the sea full of flotsam.

      I know the proprietor personally.
    agent:
      Oh. I was just trying to be helpful.
    player:
      It's okay. I forgot where it was before, but thanks for telling me the location.

      Smith... Smith, do I even need to tell you where the bar is?
    player:
      Well, no. If anything you'd be saving them the trouble of dealing with me.
      But since you proposed...
    agent:
      It's called {loc_to_unlock#location}. They're pretty cheap and everyone from the Law to the Lawless go there.
    player:
      Why thank you, my dear friend. I shall escort myself there at once!
    agent:
      Just...just don't run a tab. The bartender's is a no-nonsense type, and they have powerful contacts behind them.
    player:
      !happy
      No bartender had stood a chance to my improvisation!

      There's a bar called the Gutted Yote.
      It lies in the, ah, "lawless" part of the bay.
      Not that the rest of the bay is lawful. It's just that more questionable figures visit there.
    player:
      What does that have to do with me?
    agent:
      If you want to have connections with the darker side of the bay, that's a good place to start.
      Be careful though, they'll sell you some extra strong swill if that'd mean mugging you on the way out the door!

      I'm a politician. I use my words instead of my fists.
    agent:
      Well, some people don't really care about your diplomatic immunity.
      You never know, right?
      Anyway, check out Trusty's Outfitting. They sell all kinds of equipment. Also hats.

      If you get hurt, you should definitely visit the Better Living Chemist.
      They will sell you different types of chemicals and healing items.
      It's always a good idea to keep one or two at hand, in case push comes to shove, followed by bites and a few right hooks to the jawline.

      You should probably know where the Admiralty Headquarters is.
      Getting the Admiralty on your good side is always a good thing.
    player:
      !thought
      I don't know. Their boons are kind of useless.
      I mean, when am I ever going to use Authorization?
      Every time I need Admiralty help, they are never there.
      And when I run into trouble with the Admiralty, I can't even use it.
    agent:
      !dubious
      Is that your experience with the Admiralty?
      Well, what about Sparring? Or Commander? Have they not helped in the past?
    player:
      !shrug
      Fair enough, thanks for the location.

      Constantly.
      I mean, I am supposed to build up support and run for president within five days.
      There's not nearly enough time for me to do what I want.
    agent:
      In that case, there is nothing I can do to help you.
      Unrelated, you should visit the park sometimes.
      !agree
      It's a good place to unwind, after spending a whole day hustling.
      !sigh
      Plus, it's the only place with greenery nowadays in the Pearl.
    player:
      I will keep that in mind, thanks.

      I often drink at a place called {loc_to_unlock#location}.
      It's nothing too special, but you get to visit many interesting people there.
      We should drink at there some time.
    * You're pretty sure you're not allowed to drink with someone who you already liked, but you don't want to bring it up to ruin your relationship.
