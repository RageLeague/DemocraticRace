      If you want to have connections with the darker side of the bay, that's a good place to start.

      How is your so called revolution? Is it going well?
      Is it worth the lives that you have endangered, and the millions of shills worth of property damage that you have inflicted?
    agent:
      If changes are to happen, there will bound to be some casualties.
      Like how forest fires destroy many things in its path.
      But forest fires clear forests of old, dead trees that take up precious resources for other trees, and recycle the nutrients for the younger trees.
      Without them, the forest becomes sick, and no new life can grow.
      Havaria is a dying forest. The old, rich people hoard resources they don't need, while the others suffer.
    player:
      And it's solely up to you to decide what people should do with their lives? Who gets to live and who gets to die?
      You are an egotistical despot, sending many to their deaths for your so called "revolution". Your so called "change".
    agent:
      No, you are free to do what you like.
      But if what you are doing harms the good people of Havaria, then I will gladly put an end to this.
      Change is coming, {player}. If you can't see that, then you will be swept way by the flames of the revolution.

      Our parents might have been friends, but that doesn't mean you can speak for them as if you are their own {agent.gender:son|daughter|child}!

      There will always be injustice. There will always be inequality. And there will always be exploitation. This is Havarian nature.
      There is nothing we can do to change that.
      Many died in this pointless fight for change, and my parents are one of the victims.
      Yet you wish to send more people to die for this pointless fight.
      For what? For your own ego? For feeling good about yourself for being the "good guy"?
    agent:
      It's not about "feeling good". It's doing what is necessary.
      For if you don't fight for changes, nothing will ever change.
      Even if we can't solve everyone's problem overnight, a better future for millions of Havarians is always worth fighting for.
      And change is coming, {player}. The fact that we are even having an election in the first place is the living proof of that.
      And by the looks of it, you will not be the part of the change.
