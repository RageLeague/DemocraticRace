    agent:
      Feeling okay so far?
    player:
      !thought
      More or less.
    agent:
      How I feel depends on how you do today.

    player:
      Time goes so fast.
      I don't think I finished what I want to do.
    agent:
      I hope you at least did what is necessary for us to win.
  - |
    player:
      !sigh
      I'm so tired from all the work I did today.
    agent:
      Hopefully that the work doesn't go to waste.

    player:
      Have you thought about why we're doing this?
      Working hard to gain support, only to lose them to our opponents, and we have to continue this cycle over and over again.
      Our support could be astronomically high, yet still it might not even be enough to win.
      What is the point?
    agent:
      ...
      !crossed
      Have you done what I asked?
    player:
      I mean, yes.

    player:
      I hope we win.
    agent:
      So do I.
      And everyone else.
      But will we win? That is the big question.

    agent:
      How do you feel?
    player:
      Good, maybe?
    agent:
      I sure hope so.
      !dubious
      But judging from how badly you did yesterday, I'd take that with a grain of salt.

    agent:
      I hope you can do better than yesterday?
    player:
      !agree
      I hope so too.
    agent:
      !shrug
      I guess that's something we have in common between us.

    agent:
      Are you putting that FACTS and LOGIC to good use?
    player:
      !shrug
      Probably?
      Some people don't seem to buy it, though.
    agent:
      !handwave
      Nonsense. You can't dispute FACTS and LOGIC. It goes against common sense.

    agent:
      How do you feel for your first day of politics?
    player:
      I'm a bit overwhelmed, but otherwise I'm okay.
    agent:
      That sounds good.

    agent:
      Do you like this lifestyle?
    player:
      !thought
      It's a bit refreshing.
      Not having to put my life in danger every day is a huge plus.
      Although I don't know how I feel being in the spotlight of everything.
    agent:
      !handwave
      You'll get used to it.
    player:
      Perhaps.
