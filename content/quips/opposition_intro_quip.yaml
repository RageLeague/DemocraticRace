    Since day one, Havaria has had bandits, contraband smugglers, and corruption throughout the ranks.

    That's why I cast myself for the election. With my leadership, we can get rid of these problems at their roots.
    Unfortunately, this is an election. Society could continue to be dystopian grimdark with the cast of a few ballots.

    Havaria has had a tenuous relationship with Deltree for decades.
    This mass annexation is guaranteed to be the straw that broke the Oshnu's shell.
    !eureka
    When I become President, I will start by establishing Havaria's independence, once and for all.

    Look. You like money.
    I like money.
    If I get into office, I intend to let you keep more of your money...
    That's about it.
    * You don't feel like this person is suitable as a leader, but you don't have the courage to tell it to {agent.hisher} face.

    The common workers of Havaria have always been the backbone of Havarian society.
    But those born with silver spoons have always oppressed them.
    The workers are like fire fuel, A powder keg of revolution and change for the better.
    I intend to be the spark.

    For years, we have watched the blessed items of Hesh be treated as trinkets. Mere baubles.
    Once I'm in office, I shall cut no corner to cut this problem off.
    All artifacts of Hesh will be revered as they once were, not what they mean for the bottom line.

    I actually run a bit of an "independent" platform.
    The contraband laws are, to be frank, played fast and loose by the government.
    Unsurprisingly, I had a few troubles with that when my small business is infringed upon.
    Naturally, I got quite a few Jakes on my side. Best keep out of my way, unless you want to be drearily unequipped.
