    * You walk up to {agent}.
    * {agent} extends a hand to greet you.
    agent:
      !right
      Hello there. My name is {agent}. You may have heard of me already down the grapevine.
    player:
      {player}. Charmed to meet you, {agent.honorific}.
      I believe we should introduce ourselves a little bit better.
      For example, what drives you to run in the election? What is your goal?
    agent:
      !chuckle
      Nothing I couldn't tell you about me that the public doesn't already.
      But the gist of it is this:

    * You walk up to {agent}.
    * {agent} looks around the office, observing.
    agent:
      !right
      So, this is your campaign office, huh?
      A pretty nice place, if I do say so myself.
    player:
      Ah, {agent}. Fancy seeing you here.
      Last time we meet, we haven't properly talked about the campaign yet.
      For example, what drives you to run in the election? What is your goal?
    agent:
      Very well, I shall tell you.

    * You walk up to {agent}.
    * {agent} looks at you in shock.
    agent:
      !right
      !surprised
      {player}?
    player:
      Prindo, is that you?
      !happy
      How long has it been? Ten years?
    agent:
      !agree
      Too long to keep track of.
    player:
      I see that both of us are running in this election. I presume that you are running on a worker-centric platform?
    agent:
      !agree
      You know it.

    * You walk up to {agent}.
    * {agent} looks at you in dismay.
    agent:
      !right
      Oh, {player}. You followed me, after all.
      !crossed
      Didn't I say I can do this by myself?
      Why did you show up now, all of a sudden?
    player:
      I'm not here to help you win, per se.
      I am running for president as well, so that the Barons don't put all their eggs in one basket.
      This way, even if one of us loses the election, the other person can still win.
    agent:
      !sigh
      Fine. Have it your way, then.
    player:
      Do you even have a plan? A platform to run on?
    agent:
      Oh, I do have a plan alright. And I do have a platform.

    * You walk up to {agent}.
    * {agent} seems glad to see you.
    agent:
      !right
      !happy
      Didn't expect to see you here, old chum!
    player:
      !crossed
      I will have you know that I am running for president, so me being here is completely expected.
    agent:
      You will need more than stealth and espionage if you want to win the election.
      !chuckle
      But I guess, in that aspect, we are in the same boat.
    player:
      Speaking of which, what platform are you running on?

    * You walk up to {agent}.
    * {agent} looks at you in disbelief.
    agent:
      !right
      What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be drinking in some rundown bar or something?
    player:
      !angry_accuse
      Hey! I will have you know that I am running in the election!
    agent:
      !agree
      If you are speaking the truth, then perhaps it's finally time for you to do something useful.
      Of course, I am not going to make it easier for you.
      I actually want to win.
    player:
      !chuckle
      Right. Absolutely.
      What even is your goal? What is even is your plan after you get into the office?
    agent:
      It's not like the likes of you would understand.
      But what's the harm? Sure, I can tell you.

    Since day one, Havaria has had bandits, contraband smugglers, and corruption throughout the ranks.
    !hips
    That's why I cast myself for the election. With my leadership, we can get rid of these problems at their roots.
    Unfortunately, this is an election. Society could continue to be dystopian grimdark with the cast of a few ballots.

    Havaria has had a tenuous relationship with Deltree for decades.
    This mass annexation is guaranteed to be the straw that broke the Oshnu's shell.
    !eureka
    When I become President, I will start by establishing Havaria's independence, once and for all.

    Look. You like money.
    I like money.
    If I get into office, I intend to let you keep more of your money...
    That's about it.
    * You don't feel like this person is suitable as a leader, but you don't have the courage to tell it to {agent.hisher} face.

    The common workers of Havaria have always been the backbone of Havarian society.
    But those born with silver spoons have always oppressed them.
    The workers are like fire fuel, A powder keg of revolution and change for the better.
    I intend to be the spark.

    For years, we have watched the blessed items of Hesh be treated as trinkets. Mere baubles.
    Once I'm in office, I shall cut no corner to cut this problem off.
    All artifacts of Hesh will be revered as they once were, not what they mean for the bottom line.

    I actually run a bit of an "independent" platform.
    The contraband laws are, to be frank, played fast and loose by the government.
    Unsurprisingly, I had a few troubles with that when my small business is infringed upon.
    Naturally, I got quite a few Jakes on my side. Best keep out of my way, unless you want to be drearily unequipped.
