                    You're running for president, and you aren't even familiar with our voting system? Unbelievable.

                    And what exactly does that mean?
                agent:
                    It means that each person gets to vote once, for their favorite candidate.
                {advisor_manipulate?
                    But logically speaking, if there are more than two candidates, it is not a good idea.
                    Let's say, hypothetically, you support the Cult's candidate.
                    So naturally, you will vote for the Cult, right?
                    But, let's say, hypothetically, the Cult is not that popular, and the Admiralty is the next best candidate.
                    And let's say, hypothetically, you don't want the Rise to win, right?
                    If you vote for the Cult, the Admiralty won't have enough votes to win the election, and the Rise wins. No one is happy.
                    But if you vote for the Admiralty, they will get enough votes to win.
                    You won't get exactly what you want, but it's better than the alternative, so logically, you must vote the Cult.
                *** Okay this is the end of wall of text. I promise.
                player:
                    Those are a lot of words. But I think I get it.
                    So, if I ally with someone, votes that should have go to them are likely to go to me!

                    Exactly.

                    But that's what a normie would do.
                    Someone with a galaxy brain, however, would vote for the candidate they like that will most likely win.
                    It maximizes the chance of them getting a desired outcome.
                player:
                    Oh, so if I ally with someone, voters are more likely to vote for me because of this?
                agent:
                    That's right.
                    But hey, that's just a theory, a <i>Game</> Theory.

                    Nobody knows how the voting system works better than me.
                player:
                    You still haven't answered my question.
                agent:
                    Oh, yes. Here's the explanation.
                    It is not about voting someone you like the most, it's about voting for someone who are most likely to win.
                    Look at my fellow Jarackles there, eager to vote for someone who represent them the most.
                    But you don't represent anyone. You're here to <i>win</>.
                    And people prefer that than someone who will make drastic changes against them.
                player:
                    I see.
                    So, if I ally with someone, votes that should have go to them are likely to go to me!
                agent:
                    Exactly.
