Public Debate - “{opponent} is hosting a public debate, you might be able to make use of the large audience by swaying them to your side.”

When the player arrives at the location, the opponent finishes debating and verbally smacking down someone else. The opponent then calls out to the audience if anyone else will debate them before they wrap it up.
The player steps up and takes the mic, and then the negotiation starts.

The negotiation plays around a special mechanic: Audience Reception. This comes in the form of a core argument on the opponent, and has 5 stages.
Hostile Audience, Skeptical Audience, Neutral Audience, Friendly Audience, and Sympathetic Audience.

The negotiation always starts with a Hostile Audience, and can be upgraded through destroying bounties that occasionally pop up as well as with an incepted 2 cost card, Wisecrack. The audience will also be degraded by enemy
arguments that are not destroyed in time.

A Hostile Audience and Skeptical Audience will incept 1 Heckler to your opponent each turn. A Friendly Audience and Sympathetic Audience will incept 1 Vulnerability to your opponent each turn.

When the negotiation is completed, the results will be dependent on which stage of Audience Reception you finished with, but if you lost, the Audience Reception instantly becomes Hostile.

Example reward table:
Hostile Audience - 3 Dislike
Skeptical Audience - 2 Dislike, 1 Like
Neutral Audience - 2 Dislike, 2 Like
Friendly Audience - 1 Dislike, 3 Like
Sympathetic Audience - 4 Like
