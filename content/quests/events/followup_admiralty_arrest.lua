                            A criminal in cuffs. {admiralty} and I took {target.himher} down.
                        agent:
                            Ah, well, just leave {target.himher} here, I'll take {target} down to a cell.
                            !chuckle
                            And I'm sure {admiralty} is going to be doing a lot of paperwork tonight.
                        player:

                            About that...

                            Figures {admiralty} would clock out like this.
                            <i>Fine</>. Grifter, leave the inmate, I guess I'll sort things out.

                            Okay... You dragged a corpse into here <i>why</>?
                        admiralty:
                            !left
                            We killed {target}. Had to bring the body as proof, as per protocol.
                        agent:
                            I get that but... we could've had this interaction <i>outside</> instead of here.
                            Agh, whatever. Put it somewhere it won't stink up the place.
                        {high_bounty?
                            Only thing stronger than the smell must've been the fight. We've had an eye on {target} for a long while, for good reason.
                            I think once the forms are filled, you'll be seeing a bit of extra blood money in your salary.

                            Does that mean a promotion?

                            Oh yeah. You at least won't have to be here while the cleaning crew works.

                            Well then. An officer, a Grifter, and a criminal walk into the headquarters of the Admiralty.
                            What's the punchline for this joke? Same as usual?
                        admiralty:
                            !left
                            !salute
                            Same as usual. Grifter here helped me.
                        {high_bounty?
                        agent:
                            Gotta say, I'm impressed. {target}'s had a bounty that could see over the clouds for a while now.
                            I think once the arrest forms are sorted, you'll be seeing a bump in pay soon, {admiralty}, and a bump in authority.
                        admiralty:
                            That's incredible! Can't wait to start my new duties.
