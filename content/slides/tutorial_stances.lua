As a politician, you will often take sides on important political issues. Certain dialog options or actions will cause you to take a stance.
Taking a stance will cause your faction/wealth support to change, depending on what the stances you take are.
Additionally, having a consistent stance will slightly boost your general support, while changing your stance will reduce your general support.]]

Stances on issues can be viewed in your support screen.
The support screen will show you the political issues you have taken stances on, and the stances of you and other key individuals.
Hover over an issue will give you a summary of the issue, and the two sides for that issue.]]

Each issue have five stances. Two radical stances, two moderate stances, and a centrist stance. The more radical the stance is, the more it affects faction/wealth support.
Hover over the stance icon (the same as the relationship icons) for a description of the stance.
For each group, each <#BONUS>+</> indicates one support gain among that group when you pick that stance, and each <#BONUS>-</> indicates one support loss among that group when you pick that stance.]]

            txt = [[<b>Favoring Stances:</>

Some actions will cause you to "favor" a stance. This means that this action is agreeable to one side of the issue, with no indication on how radical your stance is.
If you "favor" a stance, taking another stance that is on the same side of the issue will count as consistent stance, meaning you will gain general support instead of losing some. The same is true if you already have a stance, and you favor another stance on the same side.
If you have favored a non-centrist stance, but haven't taken a definitive position, your stance will appear on the support screen between the moderate and the extreme stance.
Note: Centrism is a side on its own, so favoring a centrist stance does not grant benefits, and neither does favoring a side after taking a centrist position.]]
